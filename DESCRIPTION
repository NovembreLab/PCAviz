Description: The 'PCAviz' package provides a simple interface for
    quickly creating visually compelling plots from Principal
    Components Analysis (PCA) and accompanying data. See the vignettes
    included in this package for examples of plots generated with the
    'PCAviz' package. The plotting functions are also suitable for other
    dimensionality reduction techniques such as Multidimensional Scaling
    (MDS) and Local Linear Embedding (LLE).
