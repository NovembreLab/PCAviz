# PCAviz demos

Self-contained scripts illustrating the PCA and plotting visualization
functions.

These scripts have been divided into two subfolders:

+ scripts that work in an earlier release of R (specifically,
version 2.5.1);

+ and scripts that work with newer versions of R (tested in R >= 3.2.1).

Note that R 2.5.1 is installed at `/project/rcc/PCAviz/R-2.5.1/`. It
should work on *midway1* (Scientific Linux 6) and is not expected to
work on *midway2* (Scientific Linux 7).
